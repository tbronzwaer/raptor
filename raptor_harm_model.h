                        GRMONTY  version 1.0   (released February 1, 2013)

    This file is part of GRMONTY.  GRMONTY v1.0 is a program that calculates the
    emergent spectrum from a model using a Monte Carlo technique.

    This version of GRMONTY is configured to use input files from the HARM code
    available on the same site.   It assumes that the source is a plasma near a
    black hole described by Kerr-Schild coordinates that radiates via thermal
    synchrotron and inverse compton scattering.

    You are morally obligated to cite the following paper in any
    scientific literature that results from use of any part of GRMONTY:

        Astrophysical Journal Supplement, 184, 387

    GRMONTY directly from our distribution website:
